## LED Sign

Description: Python fork of Ruby code: https://github.com/pshved/muni-led-sign/

LED Sign: http://www.brightledsigns.com/products/4_x16_LED_Mini_Desk_Sign-12972-0.html

## Install

Ubuntu 12.04
 * sudo apt-get install python-numpy -y
 * (echo y;echo o conf prerequisites_policy follow;echo o conf commit) | sudo cpanm Device::MiniLED
 
Raspberry Pi - Raspbian (release 2014-01-07)
 * sudo apt-get install python-numpy -y
 * (echo y;echo o conf prerequisites_policy follow;echo o conf commit) | sudo cpanm --dev --verbose Device::MiniLED
  * Seems that cpanm on Raspbian isn't updated on stable, so we have to pull into dev & issue a verbose 

## Usage

* Entry point is `client.py`
* Quick bootstrap script to test LED sign: `python test.py`
  * Assumes LED sign is located at /dev/ttyUSB0 (edit in lowlevel.pl, if different)


## Major File Descriptions:

* __lowlevel.pl__ — Perl wrapper for Perl API interaction with the LED sign made available via the CPAN module: Device::MiniLED.
* __glyphs/*.simpleglyphs__ — Collection of custom font glyphs that allows for the composition of individual ASCII characters using binary data to turn on / off a specific LED.
* __simplefont.py__ — Loads the custom font glyphs from font/*.simpleglyphs and renders the multiline text. It achieves the rendering by creating a single 16x96 matrix comprised of concatenated character glyphs for each character in the supplied strings for each of the top and bottom line of the LED sign.
* __sign.py__ — Retrieves the rendering of the strings from lib/simplefont.rb and supplies it to lowlevel.pl API wrapper to write out to the sign.
